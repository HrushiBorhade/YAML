Basic YAML syntax
A YAML format primarily uses three node types:

Maps/Dictionaries (YAML calls it mapping)
The content of a mapping node is an unordered set of key/value node pairs, with the restriction that each of the keys is unique. YAML places no further restrictions on the nodes.

Arrays/Lists (YAML calls them sequences)
The content of a sequence node is an ordered series of zero or more nodes. In particular, a sequence may contain the same node more than once. It could even contain itself.

Literals (Strings, numbers, boolean, etc.)
The content of a scalar node is an opaque datum that can be presented as a series of zero or more Unicode characters.
